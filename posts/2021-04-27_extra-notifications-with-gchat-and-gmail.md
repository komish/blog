Google seems to be [transitioning from Google Hangouts to Google
Chat](https://blog.google/products/workspace/latest-google-hangouts-and-upgrade-google-chat/).
I'm generally of the opinion that this change is acceptable (even though Google
Chat is pretty lacking in features compared to other similar chat applications,
regardless, it gets the job done).

That said, I just noticed that Google Chat was reorganized under the
`mail.google.com` domain (i.e. `mail.google.com/chat/...`). The adverse affect
to that seems to be that I now have to enable desktop notifications for the
domain in my browser in order to receive notifications that I've received a new
message. 

This is less than ideal, as I end up getting new email notifications as well
(and I prefer not to have those, in favor of checking my email at marked points
in the day).

As an alternative, it seems I can install as Google Chat application as a
"native" application which should reduce the need for additional notification
surface. Historically I've preferred to keep them in the browser so I have one
application in my app-switcher (`alt/cmd+tab`), but perhaps I'll make an
exception. On the other hand, perhaps disabling notifications altogether makes
the most sense as an alternative.

Just an interesting side effect!
