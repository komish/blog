description: Gleaning Golang code style suggestions from code review comments.

I found a link to the Golang wiki's section on Code Review comments from this
[blogpost](https://henvic.dev/posts/go/). Maintaining a collection of common
changes requested in code reviews seems like an invaluable resources for those
looking to improve their overall code quality in Golang projects. 

Seems like a great read, so naturally I'm bookmarking here as a reference for
myself!
