description: Quick thoughts on using your own site as your main source of publication.

I don't remember exactly what I was browsing when I came across the
[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

The idea is pretty interesting, and basically boils down to your own personal
site being the source of communications originating from you. It's especially
useful in the world of social media that we currently live in.

It had me thinking about this blog. Aside from unsolved logistics related to
being able to submit a post via my phone or tablet going unsolved so far,
there's certainly a lack of ability to link things on this site to any kind of
social.

I thought about what it would take to build tooling to bridge this page and
other sites. The example workflow would involve taking posts that show up in the
RSS feed of this site having a specific tag (such as "micro", which I've applied
to this post, though that tag name might change) would get automatically posted
to an external social media location.

It seems simple enough to pull off, but I feel like this tooling already exists
and I just need to find it.

Just some food for thought.
