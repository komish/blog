If you commonly use Visual Studio Code to manipulate text documents, such as
markdown files, then I've got an extension that you don't know you've been
missing.

It's called the
[Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
Extension, and it's a utility that simply rewraps your text when it goes past a
certain line length.

I just use it out of the box, though I'm sure the line lengths are configurable.

The justification that converted me to being more aware of the need for wrapped
text was the presentation of your text files (especially things like docs that
ship with your code) as source files, just like everything else in your repos. 

This blog post describes the concept, identified as Semantic Linefeeds, well -

Happy document-editing!
