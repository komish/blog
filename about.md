I'm **Jose** and I'm a nerd, geek, musician, sysadmin, and developer based out of North Texas. I'm a musician-turned-linux-nerd (flutist) and consider myself a free software advocate! If you're looking for the professional stuff, best thing to do is check me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josergonzalez/).

On the internet and freenodeIRC, you can generally find me as **komish**. I didn't get that nick everywhere (case and point: [twitter](https://twitter.com/jose_can_see)), so if in doubt, double check with me.

# And what are you going to find here, you ask!?

If all goes to _plan_, some writing on my experiences playing with various software stacks. You'll also find random chatter about my hobbies and interests--which includes but is not limited to:

* mechanical keyboards
* cycling
* open source
* home labs
* video games
* music, music production, and music composition
* computers and software hacking
* technical learning

I don't take life too seriously so if a meme crawls into a post, I hope it made you laugh!

I do aim to be **accurate** and **clear** in my writing, especially content that is intended to be **instructional** or **educational**. If I haven't reached you effectively in an article, reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jose_can_see) or file an issue [here](https://github.com/komish/blog_content).

# I've spread falsities, you say!?

If you see an inaccuracy or a misrepresentation of some technical concept, let's get it fixed as soon as possible! Reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jose_can_see) or file an issue [here](https://github.com/komish/blog).
